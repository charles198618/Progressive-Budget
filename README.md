# Progressive-Budget

## Description 

This is an progressive-budget that I'm creating. Basically, it gives the user the possibility to use the application without being connected to internet. Basically, it's an offline functionality application. Thus, we have a transaction, and the amount, and then we add funds. Moreover, we put transaction, we substract funds, and we see that shift. But we just want to make sure it works offline. Thus, whe it's brought back online, the entries should be added to the tracker.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to solve a problem in society. Nowadays, many people can travel all over the world, people go to place where there is no internet connection. Therefore we want people to be able to use the application without connecting to internet. It is very nice to have a website that is speeder.


## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to point out is JavaScript. It is a pragramming language like Java, PHP, Python, C++. It's considered as the brain in human body. It allows us to implement complex features on web pages, animated graphics, interactive maps and so on.  It's with JavaScript that we have succeded to make this project work.

## MODULE

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included.

## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The big obstacle was how to use configure MongoDB Atlas and how to deploy the app in Heroku.
